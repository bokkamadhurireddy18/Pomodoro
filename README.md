Get a to-do list and a timer.
Set your timer for 25 minutes, and focus on a single task until the timer completes.
When your session ends, mark off one pomodoro "âœ”". 
Then enjoy a 5-minute break.
After four pomodoros, take a longer, more restorative 20 minute break.
Click Start or Reset timer anytime.
